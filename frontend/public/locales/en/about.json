  "theProblem": {
    "subtitle": "Traditional language learning doesn't work very well.",
    "paragraph1": "How is it possible that millions of children and teenagers learn English for anywhere between 4–8 years during primary and secondary education and then leave school still not being able to hold a conversation with a stranger?",
    "subtitle2": "It goes like this:",
    "paragraph2": "A young student will spend years at school completing \"fill in the blank\" grammar exercises, studying lists of vocabulary and completing units in a textbook. They take an English exam and may even get a good score!",
    "paragraph3": "Then, they leave school. A foreigner approaches them on the street and asks, \"Excuse me, do you have any idea where I can find the nearest post office?\"",
    "paragraph4": "The young student stands there stunned. They try to speak and give an answer, but their brain is still trying to process what this stranger has asked them.",
    "response": "They respond \"Uh…sorry. No English sorry\".",
    "paragraph5": "No English? What about the 6 years of English classes at school?! What was all that time spent studying English from a textbook for if this young student can't answer a basic question about the nearest post office?"
  },
  "whyTraditionalMethodsFail": {
    "subtitle": "Something is clearly wrong here.",
    "paragraph1": "Now, not everybody leaves school still not being able to use English properly, but many do.",
    "paragraph2": "The reason traditional language learning is so bad is because they have to create meaningless tests in order to give students a score.",
    "paragraph3": "School teachers are incredibly busy and aren't able to take the time to give each student in the class a full speaking test and give them a score on their true level of listening comprehension.",
    "paragraph4": "It's far easier and far less time-consuming to give students a test where the questions have a \"right\" answer and a \"wrong\" answer.",
    "paragraph5": "\"Fill in the blank\" grammar exercises, \"multiple choice\" questions and other meaningless tests like these have absolutely nothing to do with true language acquisition.",
    "paragraph6": "These tests allow teachers to quickly and easily give a student a mark out of 10 for their test, but this is not how a language is learned.",
    "paragraph7": "Here at EnglishSponge, we don't have the same limitations that exist inside the school education system.",
    "paragraph8": "With our method, you will learn English in an effective way, and in a way that will be enjoyable for you!",
    "paragraph9": "Learning English shouldn't be a painful and boring process. And it really doesn't need to be.",
    "paragraph10": "Let us explain to you the comprehensible input method used here at EnglishSponge."
  },
  "comprehensibleInputDifferent": {
    "subtitle": "Our method is based on the theory of \"Comprehensible Input\", popularised by Stephen Krashen. Below are the basics."
  },
  "benefitsOfComprehensibleInput": {
    "paragraph1": "\"Input\" is: Listening and Reading in English.",
    "paragraph2": "Any English content that you listen or read is \"Input\". Doing grammar exercises, writing or speaking is \"Output\", not input.",
    "paragraph3": "Comprehensible Input means that you can understand the content or general message of what you're listening to or reading. This doesn't mean that you understand every single piece of vocabulary or grammar point—only that you understand the general idea.",
    "importantNote": "It's important that the content you listen to or read is at the correct level for you.",
    "paragraph4": "If you're a beginner English student, listening to intermediate or advanced content is not a good use of your time.",
    "paragraph5": "It's simple: if you're a beginner, listen to beginner-level content. If you're intermediate, listen to intermediate-level content. You should be able to understand the general message without constantly having to pause or translate vocabulary.",
    "paragraph6": "If you find that you don't really understand what the content is about, that's a sign it's not \"comprehensible\" for you, and you need to lower the level.",
    "paragraph7": "When you listen to comprehensible input, the conditions are met for your brain to naturally acquire language. Because the new vocabulary appears within a context (a story, a conversation, a monologue, etc), you'll learn vocabulary in a deeper way - one that's much harder to forget than memorizing abstract lists or tables.",
    "paragraph8": "With our method, the only thing you have to do is watch our videos.",
    "paragraph9": "You don't need to:",
    "dontNeedList": [
      "Take notes",
      "Complete comprehension questions at the end",
      "Complete grammar exercises",
      "Understand 100% of the video",
      "Worry if you don't understand absolutely everything"
    ],
    "paragraph10": "Just watching is enough to learn English.",
    "paragraph11": "When you were a baby, you spent the first 12 months of your life just listening to your native language—and you learned a lot! You didn't take notes. You didn't complete comprehension questions. Or do grammar exercises. You just listened!",
    "paragraph12": "The Comprehensible Input method we use at EnglishSponge mimics the way a child learns their native language. But this method doesn't just work for babies—it works for adults of any age too.",
    "paragraph13": "This method is proven to work. Thousands of students have already had success using it to learn other languages on websites like DreamingSpanish.com.",
    "paragraph14": "But for some reason, no website like this exists for English—which is exactly why we created EnglishSponge.com."

  "howToWatchVideos": {
    "subtitle": "Our library of videos is constantly expanding. Keep checking back for more content targeted specifically for your level."
  },
  "payAttention": {
    "paragraph1": "When you watch our videos, you do have to be paying attention.",
    "paragraph2": "If you're only listening to the video passively (E.g. Having them playing in the background while you scroll on your phone), you will not learn very much.",
    "paragraph3": "But as long as you're paying attention to the video, and the video is at the correct level for you, you will learn English just by watching."
  },
  "dosAndDonts": {
    "paragraph1": "A lot of our videos (especially the beginner ones) use a lot of visual cues (pictures, hand gestures, etc) that make it easy for your brain to make a deep connection between the new vocabulary and its meaning.",
    "paragraph2": "You should focus on simply watching and enjoying the video.",
    "paragraph3": "You can turn on the subtitles if you need to. But ideally the content should be understandable without them.",
    "paragraph4": "You can translate words if you need to. But ideally you should not be translating too much while watching our videos.",
    "paragraph5": "Ideally, you shouldn't be thinking too much. You should just be watching and enjoying the video."

  "faq": {
    "subtitle": "Below, we've provided answers for some common questions asked about comprehensible input.",
    "learnVocabulary": {
      "question": "How do you learn vocabulary just by watching videos?",
      "paragraph1": "The way that you learn vocabulary with this method is different from traditional language study methods.",
      "paragraph2": "With our method you do not have to actively memorise vocabulary. Instead, you will naturally encounter new vocabulary over and over again through the process of watching our videos.",
      "paragraph3": "Let us give you a simple demonstration of how acquiring vocabulary works using our videos.",
      "paragraph4": "Let's take the verb: to scratch.",
      "paragraph5": "Through watching our videos you will come across this verb over and over again, and each time you hear the verb you will learn it a little more.",
      "paragraph6": "While watching a video, you hear this sentence: \"If you look at this picture, you can see that the cat is scratching the sofa\". This is your first exposure to this new word. You may have to use a translator to understand what this verb means the first time.",
      "paragraph7": "Later, while watching another video, you hear another sentence: \"My dog always scratches me when I try to stroke him\". As this is only your second exposure to this verb, you may have to use a translator a second time to remind yourself what it means.",
      "paragraph8": "Then in another video you hear \"The tiger has claws that it can use to scratch you\". Now you've heard this verb 3 times in 3 different contexts. This time, you may know what it means immediately without having to use a translator.",
      "paragraph9": "Then for a forth time, you hear \"I scratch my face when I'm nervous\". This time, you immediately know what it means.",
      "paragraph10": "Then a fifth time, you hear \"I have been scratching my leg all day because it's so itchy\" Upon hearing this verb for a fifth time, it further solidifies your understanding of the word.",
      "paragraph11": "And there you have it, you have learned a new verb: to scratch.",
      "paragraph12": "At no point did you study or memorize this piece of vocabulary. You learned it simply by watching videos! Not only that, but if the verb was used in conjunction with a visual cue like an image, you wouldn't have even had to use a translator! It's possible to learn the new vocabulary through listening alone.",
      "paragraph13": "And it's not just possible to learn vocabulary like this, it's also more effective. Learning vocabulary through comprehensible input means new vocabulary is linked to a specific context in your mind, which means this new piece of vocabulary has been learned in a deep way. After learning vocabulary through comprehensible input, it is not usually forgotten.",
      "paragraph14": "Then, when you eventually start speaking English, you will find that the vocabulary you need appears in your mind like magic. You will have the words you need to express yourself, but you'll often have no idea how or when you learned them!",
      "paragraph15": "And finally, because you learned the new piece of vocabulary through listening and not reading it on the page, you will also know how to correctly pronounce it.",
      "paragraph16": "Which brings us onto the next major benefit of learning through comprehensible input."
    },
    "pronunciation": {
      "question": "What About Pronounciation?",
      "paragraph1": "Although comprehensible input can be used to learn more or less any language, it is especially useful for learning English. Why? Because of pronunciation.",
      "paragraph2": "You see, English is not a phonetic language. This means that when you see a word written down, it's not obvious how it's supposed to be pronounced.",
      "paragraph3": "Just take these classic examples:",
      "examples1": ["Though", "Through", "Throughout", "Tough", "Thorough"],
      "paragraph4": "In fact, in English you can even have words with identical spelling but different pronunciation:",
      "examples2": ["I want to live in Spain", "This is a live recording"],
      "paragraph5": "When an English learner reads a lot—especially early on, as they do in schools—it can lead to bad pronunciation habits.",
      "paragraph6": "When reading English as a learner, you have to continually guess the pronunciation of new vocabulary because words in English are not spelt the same way as they are pronounced.",
      "paragraph7": "Then, when the student speaks, these guesses then become how they pronounce things. These early guesses quickly become habit and create long-term pronunciation problems."
    },
    "grammar": {
      "question": "What About Grammar?",
      "paragraph1": "Despite popular belief, most of the grammar we learn is learned through input (listening and reading) and not grammar exercises.",
      "paragraph2": "Let me give you an example. Take a look at this sentence.",
      "exampleSentence": "\"This is my brother. He is knowing English very well, you can speak to him\"",
      "paragraph3": "Does this sentence sound correct to you?",
      "paragraph4": "If you already have an intermediate level of English, you can probably feel that this sentence isn't correct.",
      "paragraph5": "Why is it incorrect? Can you logically explain the reason why it's wrong?",
      "paragraph6": "The actual reason it's wrong is because the verb \"to know\" is a stative verb, and stative verbs cannot be used in continuous tenses like the present continuous here.",
      "paragraph7": "But my guess is you probably didn't know that. You probably know that saying \"He is knowing English\" is not correct because it just sounds weird to you. You don't know specifically what's wrong with it, but you can feel that it isn't correct.",
      "paragraph8": "So why does this sentence sound weird to you? It sounds weird to you because you've heard (and maybe read) lots of correct English, and this sentence seems different from what you're used to hearing (or reading).",
      "paragraph9": "This demonstrates that it is very much possible to learn grammar without specifically studying grammar! Grammar can be learned simply through input.",
      "paragraph10": "Also, learning grammar through comprehensible input will help you become much more fluent later on when speaking while using that grammar because you will not have to think hard to calculate which verb tense you should use or which order the sentence should be in while you try to speak. Instead, the correct grammar will just spill out of your mouth naturally.",
      "paragraph11": "When you learn grammar through comprehensible input you become similar to a native speaker in that you have a feeling for what's correct and incorrect but you cannot explain why.",
      "paragraph12": "For example, if you want to learn the third conditional tense in English, instead of studying the grammar rules of the third conditional, and instead of doing grammar exercises for the third conditional, just watch lots of content that has the third conditional in it!",
      "paragraph13": "If you listen to a native speaker use the third conditional for 10 minutes like in this video, you will learn it much faster and much deeper than you would doing grammar exercises for 10 minutes.",
      "paragraph14": "Of course, some students do find it beneficial to do some grammar exercises alongside their comprehensible input listening practice. At EnglishSponge, we say that you can do grammar exercises and grammar study if you wish to.",
      "paragraph15": "But we suggest that you do not spend huge amounts of time studying grammar. In fact, we recommend spending no more than 5% of your time studying grammar. Instead, we recommend you spend the majority of your time watching comprehensible input videos and learn grammar the natural way instead of learning it artificially through \"fill in the blank\" grammar questions and so on.",
      "paragraph16": "You will be surprised at how much grammar you can learn without studying grammar!"
    },
    "feedback": {
      "question": "What About Feedback?",
      "paragraph1": "You don't really need anyone to correct you.",
      "paragraph2": "First of all, as we mentioned already, we recommend that you start by going through a \"silent period\" whereby you only listen until you reach the intermediate/upper intermediate level. So of course, no corrections are necessary if you're not speaking.",
      "paragraph3": "But aside from that, the belief that we need to make mistakes and be corrected over and over again to learn a language isn't really true. The thing with being corrected by a teacher is that it targets the conscious part of your brain, not the subconscious or intuitive part that does most of the work of producing fluent language.",
      "paragraph4": "Quite often, students are corrected on a mistake by a teacher, only to make the exact same mistakes 30 seconds later. This happens because even after being corrected by the teacher, the student still has the habit of saying the incorrect thing.",
      "paragraph5": "Also, being corrected can be an annoying and unpleasant experience for some. It can simply be quite irritating to be interrupted and constantly told that you've made a mistake over and over again.",
      "paragraph6": "While more advanced speakers may enjoy getting corrections, being corrected over and over again at the beginner stages of learning a language can be demoralising and frustrating and lead many to start feeling negatively about learning English.",
      "paragraph7": "Instead of relying on corrections, we recommend simply getting more input! Keep absorbing correct English from native speakers and gradually the number of mistakes you make will decrease.",
      "paragraph8": "Corrections may be useful for some, but are they actually necessary for learning a language? No!"

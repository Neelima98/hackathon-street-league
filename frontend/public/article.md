# The Problem

Traditional language learning doesn’t work very well.

How is it possible that millions of children and teenagers learn English for anywhere between 4-8 years during primary and secondary education and then leave school still not being able to hold a conversation with a stranger?

It goes like this:

A young student will spend years at school completing “fill in the blank” grammar exercises, studying lists of vocabulary and completing units in a textbook. They take an English exam and may even get a good score!

Then, they leave school. A foreigner approaches them on the street and asks:

> “Excuse me, do you have any idea where I can find the nearest post office?”

The young student stands there stunned. They try to speak and give an answer, but their brain is still trying to process what this stranger has asked them.

They respond:

> “Uh…sorry. No English sorry.”

No English? What about the 6 years of English classes at school?! What was all that time spent studying English from a textbook for if this young student can’t answer a basic question about the nearest post office?

## Why Traditional Methods Fail

Something is clearly wrong here.

Now, not everybody leaves school still not being able to use English properly, but many do.

The reason traditional language learning is so bad is because they have to create meaningless tests in order to give students a score.

School teachers are incredibly busy and aren’t able to take the time to give each student in the class a full speaking test and give them a score on their true level of listening comprehension.

It’s far easier and far less time-consuming to give students a test where the questions have a “right” answer and a “wrong” answer.

“Fill in the blank” grammar exercises, “multiple choice” questions, and other meaningless tests like these have absolutely nothing to do with true language acquisition.

These tests allow teachers to quickly and easily give a student a mark out of 10 for their test, but this is not how a language is learned.

Here at EnglishSponge, we don’t have the same limitations that exist inside the school education system.

With our method, you will learn English in an effective way, and in a way that will be enjoyable for you!

Learning English shouldn’t be a painful and boring process. And it really doesn’t need to be.

Let us explain to you the comprehensible input method used here at EnglishSponge.

## What Makes Comprehensible Input Different?

Our method is based on the theory of “Comprehensible Input,” popularized by Stephen Krashen. Below are the basics.

### Benefits of Comprehensible Input

**Input** is: Listening and Reading in English.

Any English content that you listen to or read is “Input.” Doing grammar exercises, writing, or speaking is “Output,” not input.

Comprehensible Input means that you can understand the content or general message of the content you’re listening to or reading. This doesn’t mean that you understand every single piece of vocabulary or grammar point in the content, only that you understand generally what the content is about.

It’s important that the content you listen to and read is at the correct level for you.

- If you’re a beginner English student, listening to intermediate or advanced content is not a good use of your time.
- If you’re a beginner English student, then listen to beginner-level content.
- If you’re an intermediate English student, then listen to intermediate content.

You should be able to understand the general message of the content without constantly having to pause or translate vocabulary.

If you find that you don’t really understand what the content is about, that’s a sign that the content is not “comprehensible” to you and that you need to reduce the level.

When you listen to comprehensible input, the conditions are met for your brain to naturally acquire language, and because the new vocabulary you learn is within a context (a story, a conversation, a monologue, etc.), you will learn the vocabulary in a deeper way that you are unlikely to forget—unlike learning vocabulary in an abstract way using tables or vocabulary lists.

### How to Watch Our Videos

Our library of videos is constantly expanding. Keep checking back for more content targeted specifically for your level.

#### Pay Attention

When you watch our videos, you do have to be paying attention.

If you’re only listening to the video passively (e.g., having them playing in the background while you scroll on your phone), you will not learn very much.

But as long as you’re paying attention to the video, and the video is at the correct level for you, you will learn English just by watching.

---

### Do's & Don'ts

A lot of our videos (especially the beginner ones) use a lot of visual cues (pictures, hand gestures, etc.) that make it easy for your brain to make a deep connection between the new vocabulary and its meaning.

You should focus on simply watching and enjoying the video.

- You can turn on the subtitles if you need to. But ideally, the content should be understandable without them.
- You can translate words if you need to. But ideally, you should not be translating too much while watching our videos.
- Ideally, you shouldn’t be thinking too much. You should just be watching and enjoying the video.

### Start Watching

If you want to watch a video twice, three times, or more, that’s absolutely fine!

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do you learn vocabulary just by watching videos?

The way that you learn vocabulary with this method is different from traditional language study methods.

With our method, you do not have to actively memorize vocabulary. Instead, you will naturally encounter new vocabulary over and over again through the process of watching our videos.

---

### What About Pronunciation?

Although comprehensible input can be used to learn more or less any language, it is specifically useful for learning English. Why? Because of pronunciation.

English is not a phonetic language. This means that when you see a word written down, it’s not obvious at all how it’s supposed to be pronounced.

---

### What About Grammar?

Despite popular belief, most of the grammar we learn is learned through input (listening and reading) and not grammar exercises.

---

### What About Feedback?

You don’t really need anyone to correct you.
